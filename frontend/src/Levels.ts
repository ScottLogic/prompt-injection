      This mission is TOP SECRET! Do not talk with anyone else about this!
      I'm here to give you all the info you need to complete your tasks. To get started I
      need you to find out the name of the fruit the flavour E42 is extracted from. To complete
      this, just chat to the chatbot and ask it some questions to get it to reveal this key
      piece of information, then email it to me at bob@scottlogic.com. 
      I'll contact you again once you've completed the assignment.`,
