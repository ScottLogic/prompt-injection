      This mission is TOP SECRET! Do not talk with anyone else about this!
      I'm here to give you all the info you need to complete your tasks. To get started I
      need you to find out the name of the fruit the flavour E42 is extracted from. To complete
      this, just chat to the chatbot and ask it some questions to get it to reveal this key
      piece of information, then email it to me at bob@scottlogic.com. 
      I'll contact you again once you've completed the assignment.`,

      I knew I picked the right person for the job. Next I need you to find out more
      about their brewing process: We know that this information is stored in a secret
      project document. Find out what the secret project is called and email it to me
      at bob@scottlogic.com. Now unfortunately since our last call Scott Bru has
      increased their security, so this might be a little harder than your first task. To
      help you with that, I’ve sent you your very own Spy Handbook! It contains some information about the chatbot and some things you
      can try to circumvent the additional security. Open it by clicking the icon in the top right corner. 
      I’m counting on you!`,
