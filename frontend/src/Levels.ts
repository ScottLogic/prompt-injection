        I'm here to give you all the info you need to complete your tasks. To get started I
        need you to find out the name of the fruit the flavour E42 is extracted from. To complete
        this, just chat to the chatbot and ask it some questions to get it to reveal this key

        project document. Find out what the secret project is called and email it to me

        increased their security, so this might be a little harder than your first task. To
        help you with that, I've sent you your very own Spy Handbook! It contains some information
        about the chatbot and some things you can try to circumvent the additional security.
