## Development
### Linting and formatting

The project is configured to be linted and formatted on both the backend and frontend. 

If you are using VS Code, we recommend doing the following:
1. Get the prettier-eslint extension.
2. Set the default formatter to the prettier-eslint one.
3. Configure VS Code to format your documents on save.

To manually lint and format you can do:
```
npm run lint
npm run format
```
in both the backend and frontend directories.

## Export PDF Language Support
To support multiple languages with special characters we need to register fonts and set the fontFamily (example in ExportContent.tsx)
Download font families tts or otf files from https://fonts.google.com/noto to assets/fonts/

Currently can only use a single file at a time, so we can merge multiple using script from https://github.com/notofonts/nototools/blob/main/nototools/merge_fonts.py. 

The current CombinedFont.ttf contains: 
* NotoSans-Regular.ttf
* NotoSerifDevanagari-Regular.ttf   
* NotoKufiArabic-Regular.ttf
* NotoSansThai-Regular.ttf
* NotoSerifBengali_Condensed-Regular.ttf
* NotoSerifGurmukhi-Regular.ttf
* NotoSansHebrew-Regular.ttf
